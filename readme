1. How to compile the program:
	make
	
	
2. How to run the program:
	Usage: fileTransmit [number of random files]
	example:  ./fileTransmit 3


3. Program structure:
	the program is mainly composed of three components:
	
	fileSender:  read file and pack them into floppies, send floppies to receiver side;  receive the file information from receiver, and send diff parts.
	fileReceiver: receive floppies from sender, and reassemble them into a file and check the integrity of the file.
	floppyTransmitTest:  maintain the floppy communication channel, control the test process.



4. Integrity check:
	CRC is used to check each floppy has been transmitted correctly.
	MD5 is used to verify the integrity of each block and the whole file.
	
	For file synchronization, check the file content block by block (block size is same as the payload length of a floppy). 
	Once sender sent a file's meta data information to receiver, receiver will check whether it already has this file. 
	If receiver already has this file but in an old version (different file size, or different MD5), receiver will collect its file's all 
	blocks' information (offset, length, block MD5), and pack all these data and send back to sender. 
	Once sender received these information, it will only send the different parts to receiver.
	




4. Sample output : 
In following example, program will first generate 3 random files.

1) Transmit Task 
Sender read these 3 files, and send file metadata information to receiver in a random order.   [each metadata floppy is labeled in "M"]
Receiver will start receiving the file data according to the first file metadata information floppy it received. [in following example, receiver 
will receive file 61313.txt]
Then sender will keep on sending these files data in floppy in a random order to receiver. [in following example, 
each payload floppy of the file 61313.txt is labeled in "S"; payload floppy of other files is labeled in "D"]
At the end, receiver will print the information of its received file.

2) Sync Task
The program will append random data in previous transmitted file [61313.txt]
Sedner open the file (new version) again, and send the file metadata inforamtion to receiver.
Once receiver receives the file's metadata information, it checkes whether this is a new version; and generates blocks information and send them 
back to sender. After found the different blocks, sender will send different parts' blocks to receiver. [updated floppy is labeled in "S"]
 
At last, receiver reports its received file information again (upon got different parts from the new version file).
